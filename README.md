Automated Chromosome decomposition in Black Fly

The goal of the project is, to segment the pixels of a black fly chromosome image into
computational bands (clusters), classify each into one of 15-16 distinct categories and identify
their sequence of bands in the given image. The solution will be a computer program that
produces the answers with an accuracy of at least 90% for the bands in the population.


A pixel, also known as a picture element (pix = picture, el = element), is the smallest adjustable
point of a rasterized image. Each pixel can take on properties of over a million assorted colorsâ€”
and when grouped together, they can portray an unlimited range of shapes and images. Pixels are
the building blocks of the digital world. The essence of image segmentation is to represent an
image with a few segments semantically meaningful to humans instead of just pixels .
Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each
chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed
from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living
creature unique.

The main objective of a clustering method is to classify the unlabeled pixels into homogeneous
groups that have maximum resemblance, i.e., to achieve maximum similarity within the clusters
and maximum dissimilarity across clusters. The data will be collected that contains the
chromosome images of black fly from Canadian science research site . These and other sources
will be used as needed to complete the project successfully.


The polytene chromosomes of Simulium ignescens from Colombia, compares them with those of
a sympatric undescribed species designated Simulium "C." The paper is useful to understand the
bands in two different species of black fly.
